## Project Features 
- We can purchase a new stock, sell an existing stock, view our account balance and view our current stock holdings.
- If the account balance is not sufficient enough to buy the stock and its selected number of units, the function asks us to add cash to the balance.
- Each time, the stock purchase costs will fluctuate. 
- This is just a simple implementation for understanding how a stock market works.
